# Democracy Under Siege - To-Do List

## Completed Format/Design Improvements Needed
These changes were successfully applied to `democracia-en-crisis-cr.html` and should be adapted for `democracy-under-siege.html`:

### ✅ Already in English Version
- Overall design structure and CSS (matching Spanish version)
- Process card grid layout (6 cards with color gradients)
- Timeline layout with markers
- Impact data cards
- Pillar cards with status indicators
- Accordion sections with toggles
- Country comparison grid

### 🔧 Formatting Changes Needed for English Version

#### 1. **Link Label Standardization**
- [ ] Review all external links in timeline items
- [ ] Standardize link labels to "Link" (currently vary: "Enlace 1", "Enlace 2", etc.)
- [ ] Location: Timeline section, impact cards, pillar cards

#### 2. **Number Format Consistency**
- Current state: Uses mixed formats (44, 60M+, 34%, 1000+, 3, ∞)
- Recommended: Standardize to regular numbers (44, 60000000, 34, 1000, 3, ∞)
- Location: "Impact on US Institutions & Trust" section

#### 3. **Pattern Title Consistency**
- [ ] Check all accordion titles for quotation marks
- [ ] Remove unnecessary quotes following pattern matching updates in Spanish version
- Currently: All accordions use clean titles without quotes ✓

#### 4. **Citation & Academic Support**
This is where major gaps exist - the English version needs:

### ⚠️ CRITICAL GAPS: Missing Academic Support

#### A. **Process Cards (6 Patterns)**
Each card has citations but needs verification:
```
1. "Law as Camouflage" (Varol 2015 · Levitsky & Ziblatt 2018) ✓
2. "Capture the Referees" (Esen 2025 · van Lit & van Ham 2025) - NEEDS VERIFICATION
3. "Neutralize Opposition" (Feierherd 2024 · Varol 2015) ✓
4. "Strangle Independent Media" (Dragomir 2019 · Varol 2015) ✓
5. "Rewrite the Rules" (Varol 2015 · Garcia-Holgado 2025) - NEEDS VERIFICATION
6. "Break Truth & Polarize" (Esen 2025 · Hameleers 2022) ✓
```

#### B. **Timeline Section (4 Historical Items)**
Need to add citations and academic backing for:

1. **2016-2020: "Lock Her Up" & Deep State Attacks**
   - [ ] Add specific research on Trump's rhetoric and institutional pressure
   - [ ] Link to academic studies on democratic erosion during 2016-2020
   - [ ] Current citations: Politico link only - needs academic backing

2. **2020-2024: Politicization of Justice**
   - [ ] Add DOJ independence studies
   - [ ] Research on selective prosecution
   - [ ] Current citations: NBC link only

3. **2015-Present: Enemy of the People & Press**
   - [ ] Add press freedom index data (RSF report available)
   - [ ] Research on press attacks and defamation suits
   - [ ] Current: RSF report mentioned ✓ but needs more detail

4. **2016-2024: Election Denial & Disinformation**
   - [ ] Academic studies on 2020 election disinformation
   - [ ] Social media coordinated inauthentic behavior research
   - [ ] January 6 analysis
   - [ ] Current: Washington Post link, general claim of "60M+ false claims"

#### C. **Impact Data Section**
Numbers presented but need source documentation:
```
- "-44 places in world press freedom index (2015-2024)" - Source: RSF? ✓
- "60M+ false election claims made in 2020 cycle" - Needs source verification
- "34% decline in institutional trust (Gallup, 2024)" - Verify Gallup data
- "1000+ legal threats & suits against journalists" - Source needed
- "3 Supreme Court appointments reshaping judiciary" - Verifiable ✓
- "∞ Erosion of democratic norms & institutions" - Symbolic only ✓
```

#### D. **Country Comparison Section**
Each country has links but needs:
- [ ] **Costa Rica**: Link to full analysis works ✓
- [ ] **Hungary**: Freedom House report - verify link current
- [ ] **Turkey**: Freedom House report - verify link current  
- [ ] **Venezuela**: Freedom House report - verify link current
- [ ] **Poland**: Freedom House report - verify link current

#### E. **Deep Dives (4 Accordion Sections)**
Each section has framing quotes but minimal academic support:

1. **Courts Under Siege**
   - [ ] Add specific case studies beyond general framing
   - [ ] Cite state of justice reports
   - [ ] Add Varol references with page numbers

2. **Lawfare & Selective Justice**
   - [ ] Add Feierherd et al. specific citations
   - [ ] Include comparative cases of political prosecution
   - [ ] Case studies beyond general claims

3. **Starving the Fourth Estate**

4. **Bots, Trolls, and Bubbles**
   - [ ] Add social media research citations
   - [ ] Disinformation spread mechanisms
   - [ ] Platform-specific data (Truth Social, Telegram activity)

### 📋 Core References Section
Currently lists anchors but needs:
- [ ] Full citation information for each author
- [ ] Links to actual papers where available
- [ ] Publication years and venues
- [ ] Access information (DOI, URL, etc.)

### 🔗 Missing External Resources
- [ ] Social listening observatory data (mentioned but no link)
- [ ] Actual disinformation research datasets
- [ ] Trump administration DOJ selective prosecution studies
- [ ] 2020 election false claims database documentation

- [ ] Add specific Trump quotes with sources (currently general framing)
- [ ] Include DOJ personnel changes with timeline
- [ ] Media outlet bankruptcies/changes due to pressure
- [ ] Judge appointment analysis
- [ ] Congressional investigations documentation

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Should Complete)
1. Verify all external links are current
2. Add source citations for all data points in Impact section
3. Document process card citations with specific sources
4. Add academic backing to timeline items

### Medium Priority (Enhances Credibility)
1. Add Feierherd et al. detailed citations
2. Include comparative judicial independence research
3. Document press capture mechanisms with examples
4. Add social media coordination case studies

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
1. Add full bibliography section
2. Include downloadable reference materials
3. Create academic sources database
4. Add methodology notes

## Notes for Implementation

- **Do not fabricate**: All claims must be verifiable with existing sources
- **Maintain international focus**: This is a global playbook analysis, not US-specific
- **Use available data**: RSF, Freedom House, Gallup, academic papers
- **Cross-reference**: Connect US case study back to global patterns
- **Transparently note gaps**: Use [NEEDS VERIFICATION] tags for incomplete research
