Should we dare to feel scared?

Are we brave enough to accept, and patiently wait for all the feelings in our heads?
Passing by… every time…

Should we begin to care?

Can we dare to sincerely stare at the holy void we often avoid?
Empty,
Complex,
Contradictory.
And comprehend that everything’s a victory?

Just like a symphony, or like a maze that always falls in place.

Can we accept the good and the bad, the black and the white, the peace and the fight?

Can we understand that the universe doesn’t have to make sense to everyone else?
(…just like impermanence...)

Can we grasp upon the knowledge as an elusive shooting star,
always crossing the infinite sky, of our beloved mind?

Can we accept that the knowledge we are after
never makes up for a remembrance and a laughter?

Can we see what we are really after?

Should we surrender to sadness? To fear?
Can we just dare to feel?
No matter what goes wrong, no matter how alone.
Because at the end we always "have" to be strong.

...

Can we use our own wounds, just like real life balloons, to lift ourselves higher and higher?
Not feeling lazy nor tired, with no complication whatsoever,
feeling light as a feather,
and smile real strong to our cracks,
never regretting the facts,
Nor forgetting that sadness and joy always rejoin.

Can we live up to this void?

Can we accept, bravely and strongly, the sadness in everyday?
Can we dare to realize we are feeling this way?

...

Can we give kindness to all? Can we really be that strong?
Even if it all feels wrong?

I mean, what else do you have to lose?
You already have your own shoes! And some knowledge to use,
And even if we lose ourselves, and everything else
We can always reverse, so what’s the excuse?
Is it so hard to let loose?

You can always change your life
and choose.

...

Can we just let all go?
Because at the end of the road
not knowing is the ultimate goal.

The ultimate principle.

Which doesn’t mean being invincible nor invisible...
It just means to grow, and to understand, that we are all the same.

We arrive to this piece of land,
naked,
Just to dare to learn.
