        <div style="max-width: 700px; margin: 40px auto; line-height: 1.8; font-family: 'Source Serif 4', serif; font-size: 16px; color: var(--text);">
          <p>Have you ever wondered how hard it is to exist?<br>
Without actually having to have, or to persist?<br>
How to enjoy what it is without destroying what is about to be?<br>
How to have and to be without actually trying to achieve?<br>
How to look pass the soul and the feeling?</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>How to live without fearing and believing?<br>
In honor and in fault,<br>
in wisdom and in halt.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Sometimes it is very hard to comprehend:<br>
That every life is not the same.<br>
That we are all but a tiny big universe,<br>
All part of a never ending coincidence,<br>
That never stops, never ceases, but always pleases.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>That even our very own existence on this small resistance<br>
That we call Universe<br>
Has its own cause and its own roots<br>
Its own problems and its own fruits.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Like a tree that never dies<br>
Like a rock that never tries:<br>
To know right from wrong.<br>
To discern weak from strong.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>To know,<br>
that our world is built upon<br>
so many complexities.<br>
That our life might just come to be<br>
just as a random entity.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Where every second and every play.<br>
Can make the difference between night and day.<br>
Can change our life in a blink of an eye.<br>
Even when we don't even have try,<br>
To find a way to understand:<br>
between suffering and enjoying,<br>
between fulfillment and avoiding.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>When just a glance, a smile or a little lie<br>
can change the world in someone's eye.<br>
Can bring down the holy sky<br>
That lives deep in all of us<br>
And constitutes<br>
the effects and cause.<br>
That can bring hell with just one rose.<br>
Or make our lives more glorious.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>When two are one, when best is none.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>When doing and not doing are just like two close friends<br>
Just like dark and light, like peace and fight.<br>
Everything happens, nothing stays, everything changes.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Because the course where the river runs its tracks<br>
It's as important as the river that never stops<br>
Because the beauty of a lovely house<br>
It's as important of the emptiness that dwells inside.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>To be or not to be, that's not the problem<br>
Being has never become a problem.<br>
Because we are from the time we are born<br>
And we become as we try to grow old.<br>
So being has never actually become a problem.<br>
(Except when are bothered by anger, sadness, or hunger)</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>But, how to deal with not-being?<br>
How to be by not-being?<br>
How not-being, by being?</p>
